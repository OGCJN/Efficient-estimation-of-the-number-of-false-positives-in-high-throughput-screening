# SmartTail - software for the analysis of false discovery rates in high-throughput screening experiments

SmartTail offers a novel approach to high-throughput testing, providing accurate and efficient estimates of false discovery rates and related quantities. SmartTail uses Extreme Value Statistics as a powerful tool for the analysis of tails of the distribution of p-values from high-throughput screening experiments. SmartTail can be used to correct theoretical p-values and compare different pre-processing methods.
