# SmartTail - software for the analysis of false discovery rates in high-throughput screening experiments

SmartTail offers a novel approach to high-throughput testing, providing accurate and efficient estimates of false discovery rates and related quantities. SmartTail uses Extreme Value Statistics as a powerful tool for the analysis of tails of the distribution of p-values from high-throughput screening experiments. SmartTail can be used to correct theoretical p-values and compare different pre-processing methods. 

## Installation instructions

1. Install the 64-bit version of MATLAB R2017b Compiler Runtime (MCR): [MCR Installer v9.3](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html).

2. Datasets.zip contains datasets used in [Rootzén and Zholud (2015)](https://github.com/OGCJN/Efficient-estimation-of-the-number-of-false-positives-in-high-throughput-screening/blob/master/Efficient-estimation-of-the-number-of-false-positives-in-high-throughput-screening.pdf). 

3. Check [supplementary materials](https://github.com/OGCJN/Efficient-estimation-of-the-number-of-false-positives-in-high-throughput-screening/blob/master/Supplementary%20Materials/Efficient-estimation-of-the-number-of-false-positives-in-high-throughput-screening-[Supplementary-Materials].pdf) for more details.
